  <div class="post-content">
    <p>The Raspberry Pi was introduced with a simple idea: a small, affordable computer that could bring real computing back into education. Not locked-down tablets or simplified tools, but a machine you could explore, break, and understand.</p>
<p>That idea mattered. It still does.</p>
<p>But looking at how the Raspberry Pi is used today, it&rsquo;s hard to ignore that something changed along the way. Not because of one bad decision, and not because anyone acted in bad faith, but because the world it entered slowly reshaped what it became.</p>
<h2 id="where-the-raspberry-pi-helped">Where the Raspberry Pi Helped</h2>
<p>The Raspberry Pi did have a positive impact in education, particularly in wealthier countries. In many schools, it became a useful device for experimentation. Students could learn basic programming, electronics, and Linux without the risk of damaging expensive classroom machines.</p>
<p>However, many of those schools already had access to computer labs. The Pi didn&rsquo;t solve a lack of access there—it added another option. That difference matters, because it changes the story from one about access to one about enrichment.</p>
<h2 id="affordable-is-relative">&ldquo;Affordable&rdquo; Is Relative</h2>
<p>The Raspberry Pi has always been described as cheap, but affordability depends heavily on context. In many developing countries, the price of the board itself was never the main barrier. You still needed a monitor, keyboard, mouse, storage, reliable power, and internet access.</p>
<p>Without those, the board alone doesn&rsquo;t become a learning environment. In practice, the Pi was affordable where computing resources already existed, and still out of reach where they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<h2 id="hobbyists-and-scarcity">Hobbyists and Scarcity</h2>
<p>As the Raspberry Pi grew in popularity, it found a large audience among hobbyists. People built home servers, clusters, media centers, and countless DIY projects. That curiosity wasn&rsquo;t a problem—but the side effects were real.</p>
<p>Demand increased, boards were bought in bulk, and availability became unpredictable. Prices rose during shortages. What had once been an easy recommendation for a curious teenager became harder to justify.</p>
<p>For hobbyists, this was an inconvenience. For young learners, it was a barrier.</p>
<h2 id="when-industry-took-notice">When Industry Took Notice</h2>
<p>The Raspberry Pi didn&rsquo;t fail—it succeeded. That success brought industrial and commercial use. The Pi became a platform for kiosks, signage, sensors, and embedded systems, including things like people-counting and monitoring.</p>
<p>From a business perspective, this made sense. The Pi was reliable and well-supported. But once companies with large budgets enter the picture, priorities shift. Education becomes one use case among many.</p>
<p>The hardware didn&rsquo;t fundamentally change. Its role did.</p>
<h2 id="the-comparison-thats-hard-to-ignore">The Comparison That&rsquo;s Hard to Ignore</h2>
<p>If the goal is learning Linux or programming, there&rsquo;s an uncomfortable comparison worth making.</p>
<p>For around £100, it&rsquo;s often possible to buy a used desktop or laptop that&rsquo;s far more powerful than a Raspberry Pi. These machines usually don&rsquo;t come with a keyboard or screen, and that&rsquo;s worth acknowledging. Even so, they often represent better value for money.</p>
<p>They run full desktop environments smoothly, handle updates easily, and behave like the computers people actually use. There&rsquo;s less friction and fewer workarounds, which means more time spent learning rather than troubleshooting.</p>
<h2 id="why-the-raspberry-pi-is-still-recommended">Why the Raspberry Pi Is Still Recommended</h2>
<p>Despite all this, the Raspberry Pi is still commonly recommended to beginners. That isn&rsquo;t really about technical merit anymore.</p>
<p>For many people, the Pi was their entry point into Linux or programming. It became a symbol of curiosity and experimentation. Recommending it feels familiar and safe, even if it&rsquo;s no longer the most practical choice in every situation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also momentum. The Pi is well known, well documented, and easy to point to. Questioning it can feel like questioning the experiences people had with it, even though the context has changed.</p>
<h2 id="this-isnt-a-failure-story">This Isn&rsquo;t a Failure Story</h2>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t about betrayal or bad intentions. The Raspberry Pi didn&rsquo;t abandon education—it grew into something broader, shaped by demand and success.</p>
<p>What was lost wasn&rsquo;t intent, but focus.</p>
<p>Open ecosystems evolve like this. The Pi adapted and survived, and that&rsquo;s an achievement. But pretending it still fills the same role it once did doesn&rsquo;t help new learners make good choices.</p>
<h2 id="being-honest-about-what-works">Being Honest About What Works</h2>
<p>The Raspberry Pi can still be useful and fun. It can still teach valuable lessons. But it&rsquo;s no longer the obvious answer for learning Linux or programming, especially when simpler and more powerful alternatives exist.</p>
<p>Learning doesn&rsquo;t require novelty. It requires access, time, and a machine that doesn&rsquo;t get in the way.</p>
<p>The Raspberry Pi didn&rsquo;t fail—it outgrew its original promise. Recognising that doesn&rsquo;t erase what it once represented. It just means being honest about where we are now.</p>
